You'll need to download the source before doing anything. Open CMD and run

```curl -o --url https://esteros.uk/starix/Starix%20Source.zip```

And let it download.
### Unzipping the Source
You can basically just extract it using 7-Zip, PeaZip or WinRAR.

Nothing special here.
### Making the ISO
First of all, you need NTLite. Thats what's most reliable for most users incl. Me.

Once you have downloaded NTLite you now need to click on Add.

Now just add the folder you extracted the files too.

Once done you should have this
